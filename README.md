# Interactive SSH client for macOS users

There are no SSH client like XShell on Windows, though there is a SecureCRT, but the user experience is much poor than the Windows version.

iTerm2 is a fair well terminal emulator, but its support for SSH is limited.

I researched ssh config file and find it really easy to take advantage of iTerm2 as a much better SSH client.
