# Interactive SSH client for macOS and Linux users.

## Why I do this?

As an OS X user, I have been eagering for a friendly SSH client for long.

We have iTerm as psudo terminal, which does perfect.
We have open ssh client for connecting to remote hosts, which does quite well, but I have to maintain the config file forever.

Things are much the same to Linux users.

Why no one can make it easier?
